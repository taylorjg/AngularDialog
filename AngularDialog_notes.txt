Ideas:

- introduce an angular service to get/list/save/delete items

- add ability to edit items

- add ability to delete items

- add a real back-end service with in-memory repository to store items
(items will disappear when the web app is restarted)

- handle errors from the service

- confirm deletion of an item

- add unit tests around the stuff above

- add e2e tests around the stuff above

- create a directive for validation to reduce the amount of repeated code
